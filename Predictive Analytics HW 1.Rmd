## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Luxemborg had the highest GDP per capita in the year referenced. Since it began reporting GDP in 1960, Luxembourg has always had one of the highest GDP per capita's in the world. They experienced slow growth between 1960 and 1980 and then their GDP grew exponentially between 1983 and 1995 and then again between 2001 and 2008.

```

```{block, type = 'written answer}

The monthly plot of Canadian Gas production shows that between 1960 and 1978, as well as between 1994 and 2005 there was relatively low seasonality in gas production. Between 1978 and 1994 there was significantly more seasonality in gas production. Because of this inconsistency in seasonality, box cox would most likely be ineffective. 

```

The seasonlity of the retail changes is not consistent, but the seasonality itself does increase with time.

```{block, type = 'written answer'}

The graphs seems to have yearly seasonality with a trend that has increased every year over the past 5 years. 

```

```{r}

gas %>%

```

```{block, type = 'written answer'}

The mulitplicative decomposition does support the graph from the previous section. It also indicates yearly seasonality and an upward trend in gas production. 

```

```{r}

  labs(y = "",
       x = "",
       title = "Last Five Years Gas Data with Outlier ")

```


```{block, type = 'written answer'}

Adding the outlier created a pretty significant increase in the trend and randomness of the data. It seems to have had little to no effect on the seasonality of the data. 

```

```{r}

gas.outlier <- gas
gas.outlier$Gas[20] <- gas.outlier$Gas[10]+300

gas.outlier %>%
  model(classical_decomposition(Gas,type = "multiplicative")) %>%

  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Gas, colour = "Data")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = season_adjust,
                colour = "Seasonally Adjusted")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = trend, colour = "Trend")) +
  labs(y = "",

```

```{r}

gas.outlier <- gas

gas.outlier %>%
  model(classical_decomposition(Gas,type = "multiplicative")) %>%
  components() %>%
  autoplot() + 
  ggtitle("Last Five Years Gas Data with Outlier towards the End")

```

```{block, type = 'written answer'}

Seasonolity still has little to no change with the outlier at the end. The trend looks better because although significant, the data continues to increase over time.

```

       x = "")

```

```{block, type = 'written answer'}

Both decompositions are very similar, but the X-11 decomposition seems to show that there is less randomness/irregulairty.

```

#Chapter 3 Question 9

```{block, type = 'written answer'}

It seems that between 1990 and 1995, the growth in the  number of persons in
the civilian labor force slowed significantly. This lead to a slow in the growth of he trend, as well as a substanial decrease in the irregularity of the data. The seasonality seems to decrease over time. Additionally, the recession of 1991-1992 is clearly visible just by looking at the slow growth in the value, trend, and irregularity of the decomposition. 

```

  labs(title = "STL decomposition of Canadian Gas Production")

```

```{block, type = 'written answer'}

There is very little seasonality in the decomposition until right before 1980, when it becomes icreasingly seasonal. This continues until bout 1990 and then the seasonality decreases and the seasonal periods become shorter. 

```


```{r}

canadian_gas %>%
 model(
    STL(Volume ~ trend(window = 20) +
                   season(window = 10),

  components() %>%
  autoplot()+
  labs(title = "X-11 Decomposition of Canadian Gas Production",
       x = "")

```


```{block, type = 'written answer'}

The trends and seasonalities of both decompositions are both very similar and both decompositions have different seasonality than the original dataset. The SEATS decomposition seems to fit a bit better, as the ireegularity is closer to the original data.

```

```

```{block, type = 'written answer'}

There is definitely a positive relationship between electricity demand the temperature in Victoria, Australia. This might be because as the temperature increases there is an increased demand for cooling devices like fans and air conditioners and therefore the demand for electricity increases. 

```


```{r}

lm%>%
  gg_tsresiduals()

```

```{block, type = 'written answer'}

The time plot shows some significant variation over time and could therefore make the model inaccurate. Additionally, the histogram is skewed to the right, indicating that the model could be inaccurate as well.

```

  model(TSLM(Demand ~ Temperature)) %>%
  forecast(
    new_data(jan14_vic_elec, 1) %>%

  ) %>%
  autoplot(jan14_vic_elec)

```

```{block, type = 'written answer'}

The forecasts seem to accurately predict the demand for electricity, but since there is a limited amount of data it is best to exercise caution when trusting this data.

```

```{r}

```

```{block, type = 'written answer'}

It seems like the demand for electricity peaks when it is warmer, but there are also increases in demand when it gets colder. Around 20 degrees celsius is the low demand for electricity, which is about 68 degrees farenheit. The model does seem to fit this trend fairly accurately.

#Chapter 7 Question 4

Because  Beta1 is the elasticity coefficient you can take the inverse of the equation and set it equal to y. This then indicates that for every change in x there is a change in y that is equal to the elasticity coefficient.

Sales in souvenirs seem to be seasonal, with sales spiking towards the end of the year. This is the time of year where many people are buying gifts, so that spike makes sense. 

```

```{block, type = 'written answer'}

Because the seasonality of the data is not consistent and actually has been increasing almost exponentially since the shop opened, log is necessary here. Log takes into account that the progression of the data may not be linear.

It seems like the model does a good job predicting the holiday sales spike and there is a small spike each March. Having more information may provide a more accurate model. For example, knowing what the weather is on certain days may draw more people to the boardwalk and therefore increase sales.
